A simple jumping game (Still adding to it) made as a means to practice Vanilla JS and get some experience modifying the Document Object Model (DOM). Press space to jump over the incoming rock object, the higher your score the faster it moves! Click on restart if you crash to reset the game.

# Visit the deployed app

You can find the deployed app via the following link: https://jumping-game.herokuapp.com/

2. cd into 'JumpingGameJS' (Change directory's into the app itself)

# Using The App Locally

3. Once the page is loaded, have fun! Press space to make the car jump over the incoming object, the game will also keep track of your high score (You also have the option of resetting your high score if you want to.)
